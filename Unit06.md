**Unit 6: Scripting Languages** <span id="6"></span> 
*Scripts are everywhere in computer science.  Any job in the computer
science field will require you to write a script at some point or
another, whether that script sets up the runtime environment for an
application or automates the build process.  Scripting languages are
primarily designed for “gluing”, i.e. connecting components. We will
first learn the basics of scripting, learning in particular how scripts
are useful.  You will then learn about the wide-ranging family of
scripting languages and the properties that those languages tend to
share.  By the end of this unit, you will be able to define scripting
and identify situations in which a script would be most useful.*

     Instructions: Please click on the above link, and read the entire
    webpage.  This is an excellent introduction to scripting languages,
    although it was written almost 15 years ago.  You will learn to
    distinguish between system programming languages and scripting
    languages (e.g strong versus weak typing, compiled versus
    interpreted).  This reading prepares you for the rest of the unit.
