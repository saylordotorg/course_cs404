**Unit 7: Logical Programming** <span id="7"></span> 
*The relationship between mathematical logic and computer science runs
deep.  As such, there are a number of programming language tools that
enable you to rapidly code efficient logic systems for deployment in a
variety of high-tech arenas, such as Artificial Intelligence, Textual
Analysis, and so on.   
  
 In this unit, you will learn about Logical Programming (also known as
Declarative Programming) and why you would use it to solve these sorts
of problems.  We will discuss the fundamental features of Logical
Programming and identify what distinguishes Logical Programming from
other programming paradigms.  By the end of this unit, you will be able
to identify the problem domain that Logical Programming covers and
recognize when you should take advantage of Logical Programming’s
considerable power.*
