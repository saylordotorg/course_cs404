Course Syllabus for "CS404: Programming Languages"
--------------------------------------------------

This course is an upper division computer science course that studies
the design of programming languages. While most of the industry uses
either procedural or object-oriented programming languages, there are
entire families of other languages with certain strengths and weaknesses
that make them attractive to a variety of problem domains.  It is
important to know about these less well-known yet powerful languages if
you find yourself working in an area that could utilize their
strengths.  In this course, we will discuss the entire programming
language family, starting with an introduction to programming languages
in general and a discussion of the features and functionality that make
up the modern programming language.  From there, each unit will discuss
a different family of programming languages, including Imperative,
Object-Oriented, Functional, Scripting, and, Logical. For each language,
you will learn about its computational model, syntax, semantics, and
pragmatic considerations that shape the language. By the end of this
course, you will be able to intelligently discuss each of these
programming paradigms, their respective strengths and weaknesses, and
the reasons why you would opt to use one over the others in a given
situation. You will also have opportunities to delve into the details of
the design and evolution of several specific programming languages,
including Scheme, Haskel, Java, C++, C\#, Perl, Python, and Prolog.

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able
to:  

-   Identify the common concepts used to create programming languages.
-   Compare and contrast factors and commands that affect the
    programming state.
-   Explain the evolution and key features of the major programming
    languages.
-   Analyze and evaluate new programming languages and new language
    features.
-   Illustrate how execution ordering affects programming.
-   Identify the basic objects and constructs in Object-Oriented
    Programming.
-   Explain the characteristics of pure functional functions in
    functional programming.
-   Describe the structures and components utilized in logical
    programming.

### Course Information

Welcome to CS404: Programming Languages.  Below, please find general
information on this course and its requirements.  
    
 **Course Designer**: Ha Nguyen  
  
 **Primary Resources**: This course is composed of a variety of free,
online materials.  However, the course makes primary use of the
following source(s):  

-   Johns HopkinsUniversity: Scott F. Smith’s [“Principles of
    Programming Languages”](http://pl.cs.jhu.edu/pl/book/dist/)
-   Stanford University: Professor John Mitchell: Lecture Notes of [“CS
    242: Programming
    Languages”](https://courseware.stanford.edu/pg/courses/lectures/214531)
-   William & Mary College: Professor Thomas Dillig: [“CS 312
    Programming Languages”](http://www.cs.wm.edu/~tdillig/cs312/)
    Lecture Notes

**Requirements for Completion**: In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials. 
You will also need to complete all assignments, quizzes and the Final
Exam.  
    
 **Time Commitment**: This course should take you a total of 107 hours
to complete.  Each unit includes a “time advisory” that lists the amount
of time you are expected to spend on each subunit.  These should help
you plan your time accordingly.  It may be useful to take a look at
these time advisories and to determine how much time you have over the
next few weeks to complete each unit, and then to set goals for
yourself.  For example, unit 1 should take 17 hours to complete. 
Perhaps you can sit down with your calendar and decide to complete
subunit 1.1 on Monday night; subunit 1.2 on Tuesday night; etc.
