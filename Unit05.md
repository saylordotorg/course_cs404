**Unit 5: Object-Oriented Programming** <span id="5"></span> 
*Object-Oriented programming languages are widely used in both
government and industry, thanks to the popularity of Java and its older
brethren, C++.  Object-Oriented Programming has many practical
advantages over other programming paradigms.  It is considered an
upgrade over the once-dominant Procedural Programming scheme.  This unit
will present an overview of Object-Oriented Programming, including
examples of the two most popular languages mentioned above.  Next, we
will discuss some of the distinctive properties of Object-Oriented
Programming, discussing the ways in which it differs from other schemes
and why it is considered an improvement over older designs.  By the end
of this unit, you will be able to describe Object-Oriented Programming
and identify the main properties of and advantages to using
Object-Oriented Programming.*
