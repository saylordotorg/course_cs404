**Unit 1: Introduction to Programming Languages** <span id="1"></span> 
*Programming languages are not very different from spoken languages. 
Learning any language requires an understanding of the building blocks
and the grammar that govern the construction of statements in that
language.  This unit will serve as an introduction to programming
languages, taking you through the history of programming languages. We
will also learn about the various universal properties of all
programming languages and identify distinct design features of each
programming language.  By the end of this unit, you will have a deeper
understanding of what a programming language is and the ability to
recognize the properties of programming languages.*
