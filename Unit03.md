**Unit 3: Functional Programming** <span id="3"></span> 
*Functional programming is not used very frequently in the industry, yet
it is very powerful.  Functional programming treats computation as the
evaluation of mathematical functions.  Functional programming languages
are deeply rooted in lambda calculus.  Make sure that you review the
material in subunit 1.2 to prepare for this unit.  
  
 Whereas older Functional Programming languages were typically designed
with a specific purpose in mind, newer Functional Programming languages
are more “general purpose” and are more widely applicable.  In this
unit, we will discuss Functional Programming’s place in the programming
languages world, first taking a look at exactly what constitutes a
Functional Programming language.  We will conclude the unit with a
discussion of some of the more prevalent features in Functional
Programming.  By the end of this unit, you will be able to identify
Functional Programming languages and, more importantly, instances in
which a Functional Programming language would be most beneficial.*
