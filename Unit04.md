**Unit 4: Imperative Programming** <span id="4"></span> 
*An imperative language uses a series of statements, contained in blocks
or functions, to control a created state and, ultimately, produce a
desired output.  Imperative languages and, by extension, procedural
languages, are extremely common and are frequently used to teach novices
how to program.  This unit will define Imperative Programming and
identify the language’s key properties before moving on to address
common control structures such as conditionals, loops, and case
statements.   By the end of this unit, you will understand how
imperative programming languages work and be able to identify their
common properties (and the ways in which those properties are employed
in imperative programming).*
